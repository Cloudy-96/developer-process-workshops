# Technical Exercise

As a Junior-Medium level full-stack engineer, you will be contributing to both the frontend and
the backend of our product.

This exercise is no different: you can choose to complete the frontend exercise, backend
exercise or both!

We suggest that you follow the following time constraints for this exercise:
- If you only work on the frontend: 3 hours.
- If you only work on the backend: 3 hours.
- If you work on both frontend and backend: 6 hours.

Regardless of which side you choose to work on, please include the following:
- At least one unit test
- A readme document which describes how to run your project and briefly explains the
main features
    - If you cannot complete the exercise in the suggested time limit, please provide a
short technical description which includes the information of what’s missing, how
you would have built it, and your thought process of how you came up with your
solution

And ensure that you write your solution using typescript (not javascript!)

**Remember**: we are trying to get a feel for how you work as a developer. If you find there is a
feature that you are really struggling with, work on the other features first and then come back to
it - don’t let it take up all your time.

Take note that we use yarn and not npm across all of our projects.

## Parts:
- [Frontend](frontend.md)
- [Backend](backend.md)
